# Emergency Navigation Rescue System

This project is a Python-based rescue system designed to assist ships in distress by identifying the nearest port based on their current coordinates.

## Features:
- **Geospatial Calculations**: Uses the haversine formula to calculate the distance between the ship's coordinates and port locations.
- **Graph Representation**: Ports are represented as nodes in a graph, allowing for efficient distance calculations and nearest port identification.
- **Excel Integration**: Reads port data (including coordinates and country) from an Excel file, making it easy to update and manage the list of ports.

## How It Works:
1. **Input**: The user provides the latitude and longitude of the ship in distress.
2. **Distance Calculation**: The system calculates the distance from the ship to each port.
3. **Nearest Port Identification**: The port with the shortest distance is identified as the nearest port.
4. **Map Visualization**: An interactive map is generated, showing the ship's location, nearby ports, and the route to the nearest port.
5. **Output**: The nearest port is printed, and the map is saved as an HTML file (`emergency_navigation_map.html`).

## Dependencies:
- `networkx`
- `folium`
- `pandas`
- `math`

## Getting Started:
- Install the required Python libraries using `pip install networkx folium pandas`.
- Ensure your Excel file with port data is correctly formatted and accessible.

## Additional Information:
- The system can be extended to include more ports or different types of rescue points.
